The project was developed in the period: February - June 2024

This project is a bachelor's thesis on the topic "Development of an MES-system component for optimization of enterprise production processes."
Its purpose was to create a functional component of an MES-system that allows optimizing the control and management of production processes at an enterprise.

  The system implements three access levels according to user roles:
  Designer:
- viewing orders received by the enterprise;
- creating work programs based on orders;
- viewing created programs;
- simulating program execution (equipment load level assessment);
- generating daily reports.
  
  Dispatcher:
- viewing programs scheduled for the current day;
- monitoring key enterprise indicators;
- viewing the status of repair reports created by the dispatcher;
- generating daily reports.
  
  Repair Team Leader:
- editing reports after repairs;
- changing equipment status (for example, from USED to STORAGE) in case of model replacement.
  
  Technologies:
- Back-end: Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, Spring Security;
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript;
- DBMS: MySQL;
- Local server: MAMP.
  
  Note:
This project is one of my first full-fledged developments, so some code parts may not be optimized or may not correspond to programming patterns and SOLID principles.
However, it became an important step in my professional growth and provided me with valuable practical experience.
